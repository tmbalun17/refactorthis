Used IDE and Framework

1) ASP NET Core 
2) VS 2017
3) SwashBuckle for documentation
4) Moq for Testing
5) InMemoryDb for unit tests as it is not relational and fast


Note: Things that were left due to time constraints

1) More validation on payloads
2) Unique Constraint on the Product Name
3) Better swagger documentation
4) Unit and Integration tests just demonstrating few samples to showcase understanding
5) Will need https local cert to run, if you have VS it should be there for dotnetcore
