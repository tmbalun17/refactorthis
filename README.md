Used IDE and Framework

1) ASP NET Core 
2) VS 2017
3) SwashBuckle for documentation
4) Moq for Testing
5) InMemoryDb for Integration tests


Note: Things that were left due to time constraints

1) More validation on payloads
2) Unique Constraint on the Product Name
3) Better swagger documentation
4) More Unit and Integration tests just demonstrating few samples
